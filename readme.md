Vapro is a light-weight performance variance detection and diagnosis tool without requiring source code of applications. It is practical for production-run parallel applications.

## Get started

### Dependencis

- MPI consistant with applications
- jsoncpp
- papi
- libunwind

### Build from source

1. modify `CPU_FREQ` to real value in `papi_wrap.cpp`
2. compile as
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

We can use Vapro easily with two steps, profiling and analysis.

### Profiling target applications
We can enable Vapro by setting `LD_PRELOAD` to preload the Vapro library before applications start.
```
export LD_PRELOAD=<path_to_libpapicnt.so>
```
Then, we can run the applitions dierectly. Alternatively, we can make `LD_PRELOAD` only effective on the applictions by
```
LD_PRELOAD=<path_to_libpapicnt.so> mpirun ./application_command
```

### Analyzeing resutls
Results will be store in the current working directory. There are four classes of files for differnt information.

   1. log0_*: all calculation events
   2. log1_*: all communication events
   3. log2_*: relative performance data of calculation
   4. log3_*: relative performance data of communication

   Asterisks in filename are corresponding MPI ranks. 


## Roadmap

- Supported CPU backends
  - ✔ PAPI
  - ✔ Linux perf
  - ⬜ [pmu-tools](https://github.com/andikleen/pmu-tools) for Intel CPU
- Supported GPU backends
  - ⬜ CUDA
- ⬜ Integrated visualization

## Contributor Guide

The development of Vapro is based on pull requests on Github. Before requesting for merging, a PR should satisfy the following requirements

1. Receive at least one approval from reviewers.
2. PR title should be concise since it is going to be the commit message in the main branch after merging and squashing.
